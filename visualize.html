        As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the 
        equator (0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, however, is the fact that the 
        southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern 
        hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth at the time of year this 
        data was gathered.
